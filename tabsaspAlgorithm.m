%Covnert G to a matrix 'D' such that D = G (X) I_J, where (X) is the

%implies that D will be a (N*J) x (K*J).

    % ===== SIGNAL ESTIMATE ===== %
    %Here, we will estimate the transmitted signal based off of our
    %estimated support set gamma_hat. This is accomplished by using the
    %Moore-Pen Pseudo-Inverse of the channel matrix D times the received
    %signals, but only on users in our estimated support set. All other
    %users are estimated as 0.
    %Save previous estimate of c_estimate and init new estimate to all
    %zeros:
    c_estimate = zeros(K*J, 1);
    
    %Iterate over all members of gamma_hat:
    for i=1:length(gamma_hat)
        %First, we will find the indices that correspond to the users in the
        %estimated support set gamma_hat in D:
        rows = 1:N*J;
        cols = ((gamma_hat(i) - 1)*J + 1):(gamma_hat(i)*J);
    
        %Generate appropriate indices of c_estimated such that we store in
        %correct user
        c_start = ((gamma_hat(i) - 1)*J + 1);
        c_stop = gamma_hat(i)*J;
    
        %Next, we solve for the estimated transmitted signal:
        c_estimate(c_start:c_stop) = pinv(D(rows, cols)) * p;
    end
        
    
    % ===== RESIDUE SIGNAL UPDATE ===== %

    %residue signal:
    r = p - D*c_estimate;
    
    
    % ===== CHECK IF WE HAVE DECREASED POWER IN RESIDUE SIGNAL ===== %
    %Compare the power of the residue signal after this rounds iteration of
    %estimating transmitted signals with last rounds residue signal power.
    if norm(r) < norm(r_prev)
        
        % ===== POWER DECREASED BETWEEN ROUNDS ===== %
        %We assume that our current sparsity level is correct, and we allow
        %it to remain fixed. We update the support set from the estimated
        %support set
        gamma = gamma_hat;
        gamma_hat_prev = gamma_hat;
        c_estimate_prev = c_estimate;
        r_prev = r;
    
    else
        
        % ===== POWER DID NOT DECREASE BETWEEN ROUNDS ===== %
        %Because residue power did not decrease, we will assume that we
        %have limited our sparsity too much. We will increment sparsity by
        %one. This means we will consider one potential additional user who
        %encoded data into Y's original received signal. We will also save
        %the current estimated transmitted signal c_estimated as well as
        %the current estimated support set. We do this because we may
        %increment the sparsity and read in noise, which would be
        %incorrect, so we need to maintain a record of the last valid
        %'good' estimated transmitted signal.
        
        %Save estimated transmitted symbols for last sparsity level
        c_hat_s_prev = c_hat_s;
        %Save estimated support set for last sparsity level
        gamma_hat_s_prev = gamma_hat_s;
        
        %Increment Sparsity Level
        s = s + 1;
        
        %Save the last estimated symbols
        c_hat_s = c_estimate_prev;
        %Save the last estimated support set        
        gamma_hat_s = gamma_hat_prev;
    end
    
    
    % ===== CHECK NOISE FLOOR THRESHOLD CONDITION ===== %
    %c_estimate contains the estimated transmitted symbol for s users. We
    %want to ensure that we decode as many messages as we possibly can. If
    %we terminate early, we may be missing messages, but if we continue
    %trying to decode messages, we may be making messages out of the noise
    %floor. This is not intended, so, we analyze the power of the estimated
    %transmitted symbols of c for each user in our estimated active set
    %gamma_hat. If we find that the power associated with this estimated
    %message is lower than the noise floor, we say that we have gone too
    %high in our sparsity level. This is our terminating condition, and we
    %use the last valid sparisty measure.
    
    %Obtain power measure of estimated transmitted symbol for each user in
    %the estimated support set gamma_hat:
    c_power = zeros(1, length(gamma_hat));

        %c_estimate
        c_start_index = (gamma_hat(m) - 1)*J + 1;
        c_stop_index = (gamma_hat(m))*J;

        %calculation to c_power set
        c_power(m) = norm(c_estimate(c_start_index:c_stop_index))^2;
